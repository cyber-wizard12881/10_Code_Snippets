My 10 Favorite Code Snippets

“There are but 10 ways to do things in Computers!”

<p> We all as Programmers by profession, write a lot of code on a day to day basis. </p>
<p>It is interesting to use the word 'write' here, as the job of a Computer Programmer is in many ways similar to a Novelist or an Author writing a Book. </p>
<p>Just like an author relishes writing, so do programmers. There may be certain parts or passages that might have made the works, popular & etched it into the annals of history.</p>
<p>So, irrespective of whether you are an author, or a programmer, or both, you may have a compendium of memorable & favorite pieces of work or writing.</p>
<p>This post is about some of them, that I as a Programmer absolutely loved & cherished! Some of them came as a jolt of inspiration while the others out of hard work or perseverance!</p>
<p>So lets embark on a Journey through Code of different Languages & Culture .... Bon Voyage!</p>
<p>The count down from 10 begins now:</p>

[10] [In-Place Swapper in Visual Basic .NET](001_10_a.vb) {Notice the operations of subtraction & addition in this snippet!} <br>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[In-Place Swapper in FSharp](002_10_b.fs) {Notice the terseness of this approach as functions are first class citizens in F#}

[9] [Permutations & Combinations](003_09.cs) {Notice the recursion of visiting current element, split into prefix & suffix and shift right in permute. Also how removal of duplicates results in combinations} <br>

[8] [Min Contiguous Sum](004_08_a.py) {Notice the use of local & global minima} <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Min Contiguous Product](005_08_b.py) {Notice the use of greedy approach and convergence to the center from outside}

[7] [Towers of Hanoi](006_07.cs) {Notice the build up of the solution from having just 2 disks!} <br>

[6] [Regex for IPV4 Address](007_06.sh) {Notice the composition of the solution by breaking down the number 255 into its constituents!} <br>

[5] [Pirates N Gold Coins Problem](008_05.cs) {Notice the solution can be arrived by reversal in time ... think if only 2 persons were on board the ship, then the 3rd came, then the 4th one & so forth speaking in general!!} <br>

[4] [Bridge Crossing Problem](009_04.cs) {Notice the use of recursion & flag to indicate direction & also the sorted set data structure to help with the book keeping.} <br>

[3] [Anagrams](010_03.cs) {Notice how ordering random set of chars brings order to the problem ... this is chaos engineering!} <br>

[2] [2 Closest Numbers](011_02.cs) {Notice how again, sorting & iterating over in the 2nd pass to determine closeness works wonders!!} <br>

[1] [Edit Distance Problem](012_01.cpp) {Notice how Memoization, Dynamic Programming & Backtracking come to the rescue here!!!} <br>

[0] [BFS(Breadth First Search)](013_00.cpp) {Notice how recursion, Queue Data structure & the Associative list do the record keeping here!!!} <br>

<p>Now that we have Navigated & Maneuvered our way through the dense thicket of Code, this Jungle doesn't seem to be wild at all! <br>
It feels like the Garden of Eden, a true Paradise above all.
<p>
Moreover, we can certainly feel the unity of the World of Programming Languages.</p>
<p>Though we might speak different languages, we all converse with the ultimate objective of getting our ideas & thoughts across.
</p>
<p>It is by sharing such notions that we thrive & evolve as Human Beings! <br>
The same holds true with Computers! <p>
The aim of Programming is to build not only elegant software, but sustainable systems which would empower the very users of it! </p>
<p>The Sign of Good Software or Code is that it not only conveys it's ideas efficiently, but also inspires the ones reading it!! </p>
<p>That's where the juncture of Creativity, Art, Literature & Science, Engineering & Computers converge! </p>
For, writing good code is like writing a good book, you never know what is going to come, but enjoy every bit of it! </p>
<p>With That, we come to the end of our Journey!!</p>
<p>So, go ahead & write some code!! And never stop reading!! You may never know what's in store for you!!!</p>
<p>Happy Coding!!!</p>
